## Introduction 
Selection sort is a sorting algorithm. Sorting algorithm
are used to arrange the array in particular order.It finds 
the smallest element and brings it to the beginning.Two subarrys
are maintained.
1. The sorted subarray.
2. The unsorted subarray.
In every iteration minimum element from the unsorted array is
is picked and moved to the sorted array.

## Algorithm 
* Set first element as minimum.
* Compare the minimum element with second element and if
the second element is smaller then assign it to minimum.
* Then,go on comparing minimum to the end of array.
* Swap the first element and minimum.
* For next iteration start from the second element as first 
element is already sorted.
* Repeat these steps till array is sorted. 

## Example
```

arr[] =  25 6 10 22 99
1st iteration:
Minimum element is 6 and starting element is 25 so we swap
25 and 6.
The array becomes
arr[]= 6 25 10 22 99

Iteration 2:
Here we start from second element. 
Minimum element is 10 and starting element is 25 so we swap
10 and 25.
arr[]= 6 10 25 22 99 

Iteration 3:
Here we start from 3rd element. 
Minimum element is 22 and starting element is 25 so we swap
25 and 22.
arr[]=6 10 22 25 99

Hence,our array is sorted.

```

## Code
``` c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std ;
void selection_sort(int a[],int n){
  for (int i=0;i<n;i++){
//Find minimum element 
    int min = i;
    for(int j=i;j<n;j++){
      if(a[j]<a[min]){
        min=j;
      }
    }
    swap(a[i],a[min]);
  }
}

int main() {
  int n;
  cout<<"Enter size of array"<<endl;
  cin>>n;
  int a[1000];
  cout<<"Enter array elements "<<endl;
  for (int k=0;k<n;k++){
    cin>>a[k];
    
  }
  selection_sort(a,n);
  for(int y=0;y<n;y++){
    cout<<a[y]<<" ";
  }
  
}
```

``` python
def selectionSort(array, n):
   
    for i in range(n):
        minimum = i

        for j in range(i + 1, n):
         
            # to sort in descending order, change > to < in this line
            # select the minimum element in each loop
            if array[j] < array[minimum]:
                minimum = j
         
        # put min at the correct position
        (array[i], array[minimum]) = (array[minimum], array[i])


data = [ ]
size = int(input("Enter size of array"))
print("Enter array elements ")
for i in range(size):
     e=int(input())
     data.append(e)
selectionSort(data, size)
print('Sorted Array in Ascending Order:')
print(data)

```

## Sample Input and Output 
### Input
```
Enter size of array: 5
Enter array elements :
5 4 3 2 1 
```
### Output
```
1 2 3 4 5 
```

## Complexity Analysis 
Worst Case Complexity: `O(n^2)`
If we want to sort in ascending order and the array is in 
descending order then,the worst case occurs.
Best Case Complexity: `O(n^2)`
It occurs when the array is already sorted
